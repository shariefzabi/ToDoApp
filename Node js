difference between multi threafing and multi process

Worker Thread vs. Child Process
Worker Thread
Definition: A worker thread is a separate thread of execution within the same process. It shares the same memory and resources as the main thread.
Memory: Shares the same memory space with the main thread, which allows for faster data sharing but requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions.
Communication: Communicates directly with the main thread through shared memory, which is fast but requires mechanisms like mutexes or semaphores to avoid conflicts.
Creation: Creating and managing threads is generally faster and less resource-intensive than creating processes.
Use Case: Ideal for tasks that require frequent interaction with the main thread and can benefit from shared memory, such as I/O operations, handling multiple connections in a server, etc.

Child Process
Definition: A child process is a separate instance of a process, with its own memory space, which is created by the parent process.
Memory: Has its own independent memory space, which prevents memory conflicts but makes data sharing more complex and slower due to the need for inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, message queues, or shared memory.
Communication: Communicates with the parent process via IPC, which is slower compared to direct memory access used by threads.
Creation: Creating a child process is more resource-intensive and slower than creating a thread, as it involves duplicating the process's memory space.
Use Case: Suitable for tasks that need to be isolated from the main process or require their own memory space, such as running separate programs, handling computationally intensive tasks, or ensuring that a crash in one process does not affect the main process.
Summary
Worker Threads are used for lightweight tasks requiring shared memory and fast communication but need careful synchronization.
Child Processes are used for heavier, isolated tasks requiring separate memory and more robust error isolation but involve more overhead for creation and communication.
