what  are the interfaces in typescript
An interface is a syntactical contract that an entity should conform to

An interface contains the name of all the properties along with their types. It also includes the signature for functions along with the type of arguments and return types
Interfaces contain only the declaration of the members. It is the responsibility of the deriving class to define the members. It often helps in providing a standard structure that the deriving classes would follow
Interfaces in TypeScript are created by using the interface keyword followed by the name of the interface, and then a {} block with the body of the interface

what are clases in typescript
 type script supports object oriented  features like clases and interfaces etc,a class interms of oop  represents  blueprint for a object,the class encapsulate data for a object,Typescript gives built in support for this concept called class.
we have to use a keyword class and the classname and pair of parentheses to create a  class
a class can contain three things 
1)class filelds :A field is any variable declared in a class
2)constructor :A constructor is a special function of the class that is responsible for initializing the variables of the class.
3)methods :Functions represent actions an object can take. They are also at times referred to as methods
to create the instance of a class we have to use new keyword followed with the className
the new keyword is responcible for instantiation, and the constructor should be passed with values if it is parametrised
